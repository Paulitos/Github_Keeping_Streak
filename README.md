This code with make a commit at 00:00 UTC every day for your streak to count on github. All green gardener üßë‚Äçüåæ  
In the `daily-commit.yml` provided you have to change:
* `git config --global user.name "Your_name"` with your actual name
* `git config --global user.email "Your_email"` with your actual email
* `git push https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}@github.com/Your_username/Your_repository_name.git` with your actual repository url

The use of the private token is in case you make the repository private; you need a Personal Access Token (PAT) to run Github Actions on a private repository.

To make a private token you have to go to your repository settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> tokens (classic)

When selecting the Scopes, select the `repo` and `workflow`, the expiration you can set it to 90 days (just general good practice, just in case it gets leaked)

Once you have the PAT go to your repository settings -> Secrets & variables -> Actions -> Secrets -> New repository secret, name it PAT_TOKEN and paste it
